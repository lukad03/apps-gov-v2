    "long_description": "The NX infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas (NX IaaS) cloud system is a government-owned, contractor-managed General Support System (GSS) using VCE vBlock technology hosted entirely within two contractor data centers: CSC Norwich, Connecticut (Primary Host Facility) and CSC Newark, Delaware (Alternate Processing Facility). The system supports DHS/FEMA and future tenants by providing a platform on which to host major/minor applications using Windows-based and UNIX/Linux-based operating systems in a virtualized environment via VMware and relies upon Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) isolation to separate tenants from one-another. <br/><br/> All system access to NX IaaS for authorized personnel is managed using a mixture of Smart Card authentication based upon Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 requirements and Password Authentication in accordance with FedRAMP requirements. <br/><br/> CSC utilizes their Government Security Operations Center (GovSOC) to provide, but not limited to, the following services to support NX IaaS operations: <ul> <li>Network/Host Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems</li> <li>Security Incident & Event Management (SIEM)</li> <li>Audit Log Storage & Monitoring</li> <li>Vulnerability Scanning & Alerting</li> <li>Security Incident Response Services</li> </ul> For more information about CSC and its services, visit www.csc.com", "sales_poc":"christos.skeadas@fema.dhs.gov",
