The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider services leveraged for this solution are Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Akamai Content Delivery Network (CDN). The WC2 system provides a platform for government customersâ€™ systems and applications to allow them the capability to utilize cloud computing hosting environments. This platform supports a range of highly-available web services hosted within AWS and delivered to end-users via the Akamai Content Delivery Network (CDN). The WC2 infrastructure allows Treasury customers to focus on the operational and business aspects of their web presence such as usability, information architecture and content authoring without having to re-invent and configure the technical infrastructure each time.",
