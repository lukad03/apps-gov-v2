This infrastructure and platform service offering is a highly secure, enterprise-class, cloud computing environment enabling government agencies, contractors and non-government organizations governed by federal regulations (e.g.: educational institutions, HIPAA-governed entities, and critical infrastructure ) to operate in the cloud with greater agility and flexibility while adhering to rigorous security, privacy, and IT governance controls required by the federal government. <br/><br/> HPE Helion for Public Sector consists of multiple components that can exist in a single cloud or operate within multiple clouds: <ul> <li>infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas (IaaS): allows consumers to build and manage Windows, Linux and/or UNIX services to host system middleware or applications they install and manage themselves. The service enables users to quickly provision both virtual and physical servers in a consumption- based model. The service also allows clients to co-locate customer-owned physical devices such as RISC chipset servers or hardware security modules (MSM) in the same data center as their cloud servers.</li> <li>Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaaS): enables consumers to implement a disaster recovery capability to meet federal, state and local requirements for contingency planning. This solution automatically collects and maintains complete images of the servers and network in their cloud, and can restore the entire cloud without client intervention. This managed service also includes assistance with disaster recovery planning and annual DR rehearsals.</li> </ul> Government agencies can benefit from HPEâ€™s service excellence and over 50 years of public sector experience, with a solution built from the ground up with security and best practices in mind.
