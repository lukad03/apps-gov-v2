Isolated from the rest of the team, they turned the\nidea from a skunkworks project into a product that outperforms competitor\nservices. Growing fast and innovating faster, Mandrill is now the largest Email\nas a Service platform on the market, with more than 375,000 active customers.\nUse Mandrill to send automated one-to-one email like password resets and welcome\nmessages, as well as marketing emails and customized newsletters. Mandrill is\nquick to set up, easy to use, and ridiculously stable. We made it for\ndevelopers, who love documentation, integrations, high delivery rates, webhooks,\nand analytics. If you're not comfortable with code and APIs, we recommend\nfinding someone who is before getting started. Mandrill comes with a beautiful\ninterface, flexible template options, custom tagging, and advanced tracking and\nreports. Mandrill is the only email infrastructure service with a mobile app\nthat lets you monitor delivery and troubleshoot from wherever you are. It's also\npowerful, scalable, and affordable.",
